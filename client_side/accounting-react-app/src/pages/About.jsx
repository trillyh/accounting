            <h3>This project has two purposes: 
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Teach concepts of Accounting such as journal entry, debit and credit,
                balance sheet, financial statement, statements of cash flow CFO CFI CFF. The teaching style will be in somewhat "active"
                and visual. Oh, did I say there will be NLP to classify plain text to Journal Entry? 
                </li> Your own financial statement. You can manage and generate all of the statements stated above for your business, or just yourself.
                Personal financial statement? Ye, when I first learned Accounting, the concepts of categorizing expense and income opened my eyes. 
                Imagine if you can look at your personal balance sheets and financial statement, you will have more detail of how much you "worth", how
                much is your liquidity, assets, or elevate your credit card balance by calling it "Account Payable". 
                "Wait wait, what about stockholders Equity?" How much your parents support you financially? You can't just take the money and forget that
                it come from your parent right? If we are good children, wouldn't we want to pay them back some day (Dividends)? There you go.
                In short, let's think about it as a fancy way to gamify your personal finance.
            </ul>
